Project Summary
For this project, I made a basic calculator program in C++. It lets the user enter two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, or /), and then it shows the result. It also checks for division by zero to avoid errors. The main goal was to practice handling user input, doing basic math operations, and making the code clean and easy to follow.

What I Did Well
I think I did a good job keeping the code simple and easy to understand. I made sure to handle division by zero and allowed users to enter 'Y' or 'y' when deciding if they want to do another calculation. I also added clear comments to explain what each part of the program does.

Improvements I Could Make
If I had more time, I would improve the input validation. Right now, if someone types a letter instead of a number, the program could crash. Adding more checks would make it stronger and avoid unexpected problems. It would also make it a little more secure.

Most Challenging Part
The hardest part was making sure the program handled user input correctly, especially checking for division by zero and making the loop work right. I fixed it by looking up examples online and reading C++ documentation. That helped me understand how to structure the loop better.

Transferable Skills
This project helped me get better at handling input, using loops, and writing clean if-else statements. These are skills I can use in other coding projects and courses. It also made me think more about edge cases and testing my code properly.

How I Made the Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
I kept the code organized and added comments to explain each section. I used simple logic that makes it easy to update later if I want to add more operations or extra features. Keeping things readable makes it easier for me or anyone else to understand it later.
